## Intentions and Properties of Work Management


### Efficiency and Effectivity

* Efficiency ("Doing things right") - effectivity ("Doing the right things")
* Work management (as defined here) focusses on efficiency and doesn't provide much facility regarding effectivity.
* However, good work management is considered to lay a foundation for effectivity
  by providing a reliable information source to base decisions on.


## Work Management Tooling

* Jira, Monday, Asana, etc.
* Also software development management tools; Jira, Azure DevOps, Github, Gitlab, etc.
