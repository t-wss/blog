# Work Management for Software Development

Work management for software development - as it is described here - is a systematic approach
to manage work in a professional environment.

The term "work management" is rather new; it doesn't have one commonly accepted definition
and a well established formal foundation yet (like "project management" does, for example);
instead everybody is defining and using the term slightly different, as it fits their intent.

This documentation about "work management" is considered to be

- a system describing and defining activities and the flow of work of individuals and teams
  within an organizational unit
- an abstract framework; it is intended to be a foundation which provides a set of
  elements and practices and which actual work management processes for a specific
  organization, team or project can be built upon
- concise, consistent and helpful
- (partially) opinionated. The approach taken here has a range of use cases in mind;
  as already stated, there are various other approaches to work manangement which may be
  a better fit for a specific organization or team.

Work management by itself is a universal concept which is not limited to specific domains;
however, each domain with its typical activities requires its own approach.
The documentation here focusses on software development activities.
