_"I agree fully with your view that history should reflect a "final version" of what happened during development,
not the rough draft based on how the dev actually made changes. (I've heard this called the "clean history" approach,
and I first ran across it on the linux kernel mailing lists.) And I've worked with this method, and it's great,
but it requires the focus to do it, and intermediate git skills as well. I would love to always have clean history,
but I messy one is much better than an abandoned history. (In my view, at least.)"_
