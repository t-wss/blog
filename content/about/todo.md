## Source Text Formatting

* Use Github flavoured Markdown.
  * https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github
  * https://github.github.com/gfm/
* Optimize for Github as reader (currently).
* Use **stars for bold text** and _underscores for italic text_.
* `Code` and `commands` in backticks; (at least) triple backticks for blocks.
* For unordered Lists prefer '*' over '-'.
* For fenced code blocks prefer ``` over ~~~; prefer 3 fence characters.
* Github alerts (i.e. flavoured blockquotes)

* Should heading 1 be reserved for title (makes it basically unused within the document)?
