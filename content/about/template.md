## _&lt;How-To&gt;_

_&lt;This is the template for pages on this site; it contains a how-to for creating content
and provides a template structure.&gt;_


### _&lt;Meta Text&gt;_

_&lt;&gt;_

Meta text is information or template text which is not considered content but
refers to the document itself. Meta text can provide guidance and help for the author.
Usually, meta text is part of templates and instruction pages; it is usually deleted
once the actual text is done.

_&lt;Meta text is usually written in italics in angle brackets.&gt;_


### _&lt;How to reference&gt;_

_&lt;Referencing other sources from a page loosely follows Wikipedia principles:<sup>[1](#r1)</sup>&gt;_

* _&lt;Links to internal content are inline links within the text.&gt;_
* _&lt;Links to external content are footnotes in the text which refer to the [References](#References) chapter
  at the bottom of the page where the actual link is located.&gt;_
* _&lt;The source syntax for external links uses manual HTML formatting (instead of other markup facilities,
  for example GFM markdown syntax footnotes<sup>[2](#r2)</sup>).&gt;_


# Title


## References

_&lt;The chapter "References" contains a collection of links to external content. The document refers to those links
by their numerical index.&gt;_

_&lt;The template for a reference to external content is: ```<sup>[x](#rx)</sup> ``` (footnote),
```<a name="rx"/>[title](https://link)``` (References chapter entry).&gt;_

The references for this page are:

1) <a name="r1"/>[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking)
2) <a name="r2"/>[Basic writing and formatting syntax - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes)
